# README Generator Application
## Description
This is a terminal-run app that creates a quality README file with markdown formatting. I designed it to help me make my REDME files faster, and help my fellow developers as well! I learned a lot about markdown formatting during the development process.  <br><br>

## Installation
This app is run in the terminal. Download the repository from my GitHub account and run index.js from your terminal to start up the application. 
## Usage
Once you run index.js, you will be met with a series of questions in the terminal. The app will take your input and use it to create the README file. The resulting file will appear in the root folder of the local repository on your computer. <br> <br>
There is a video on YouTube that displays the app's functionality. Watch it here: https://youtu.be/FsgsoDR-3o0?si=WSY0DOl6Z4ra7Rz2 
## Credits
